‘Yeehaw, we’ve made it out of Dodge now! Found ourselves in the midst of a field where the land opens into a basin. The lake’s gone thin with age—slim, sure, but not empty, and the water’s still in motion if you keep your eye on it for long enough.’
‘The ground darkens when I kneel—means it’s good for planting crops. Yup! Definitely the best piece of land in miles. We got good fields for pasture, and what I think could make a wonderful mine.’
‘I’ve been a fool my whole life, and this rut I'm in is no exception. All this effort to run away from the debtors back home, just to land in a brand new hole. I probably shoulda listened to ma and just put my money where my mouth was. But momma didn’t raise a quitter either, so I s’pose I’ll work with what I have here.’
[ ]This dates back a few decades.      "
