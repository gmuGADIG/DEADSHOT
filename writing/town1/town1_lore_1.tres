‘I’ve grown restless these last few days. It certainly doesn’t help that I keep hearing all sorts of noises throughout the town at night. I can usually rationalize my fears away, but last night I heard footsteps.’
‘I tried to convince myself that it was just a rogue horse or tumbleweed passing through the town, but I couldn’t rid myself of the thought that it could be him, finally coming back home. It seems stupid, I know, thinking that he would just find his way back here all of a sudden.’
‘The disappearance of my son makes me scared. Not just for him, but for whoever, or whatever, caused him to just vanish like that. I heard footsteps the night he disappeared, too. I fully believe that whoever was walking through town then knew what happened to him.’ 
‘It’s a foolish thought, but I’ve never been wrong about a gut feeling before. I’m not gonna stop believing now. I just pray the wind doesn’t blow my journal about the desert like last time...’"
