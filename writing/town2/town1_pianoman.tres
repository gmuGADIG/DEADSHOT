“Y’know, I used to play for this whole town. Damn near everybody’d flow into the saloon after a hard day's work, grab some drinks and listen to my music. People used to dance, too.” 
“You should’ve seen it, pure joy. She used to dance… she’d always do this thing where she’d waltz around the tables… God, she was just so exhausted last I saw her. I hope she’s okay… she has to be.”
“This damn place used to be so happy... Dancin’, singin’, laughin’... funny how life can just go so wrong, huh? You’d never guess that now.“
