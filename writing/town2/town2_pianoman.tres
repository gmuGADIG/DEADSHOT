“Probably thought this town would still be like the good times, huh? Damn near everybody'd flow into the saloon after a hard day's work, grab some drinks, and listen to me tickle the ivory. People danced.”
“Remember Eleanor, Zoa’s late wife? Always brightened up the place with her free spirit. She made the town feel like a family. Never needed a drink to do it, either. A shame she fell ill...forget what it was that killed her.”
“For me, though, it was Callie. God, she’d weave a waltz around the tables every night. But like everybody else, she’s too busy surviving now to spend time truly living.”
“I hold on to the good I once saw in these people. That’s why I don’t mind you being here, gunslinger—I could never look at you bitterly. Maybe I’m too sentimental for my own good.”"
