\"My husband, he... got sick. Things just haven’t been the same since.” 
“I really thought him being gone would be the downfall of this town. However, the crops started growing. Strangely quick, I don’t even need to care for them.” 
“I don’t know how to take care of the farm. My husband knew though, he used to feed the whole town. I didn‘t think I'd be able to feed my little boy after his passing.” 
“I just… I don't know how to feel anymore. The crops are growing so fast. There'll be enough for the entire town. Maybe…maybe this infection isn’t too terrible. But, I hold only fear in my heart, is it really worth all of this pain?”"
