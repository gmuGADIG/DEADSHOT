‘My love is a rider, wild bronchos she breaks’
‘Though she’s promised to quit it, just for my sake’
‘He ties up one foot, the saddle puts on’
‘With a swing and a jump she is mounted and gone’
There's some writing on the back of the page...
‘These days, nobody’s dancing. I keep playing in hopes the townsfolk might hear it, holed up in their homes, and smile a little.’ 
‘Sometimes I start doubting if I can keep this up. But I remind myself I’m not just performing for this town—I’m performing for Callie. I just want to see that infectious joy on her face again...we all do.’"
