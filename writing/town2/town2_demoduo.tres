[Biff] “Hah, yeah... Huh? Oh, great, it’s Slimwater’s show pony coming to kill the party again.”
“Hey, didn’t you get kicked outta town or somethin’? I knew we were gettin’ away with more than usual recently.”
[Slug] “Got a fix of killin’ up north. These guys’re real gooey, ain’t they? Makes the explosions seem a whole lot fatter when they splatter.”
[Biff] “Mmmmhm! Wish we coulda stayed, but after hearin’ the music of bullets comin’ from town, we hightailed it over! Hopin’ there’ll be an encore!”
