dialog = "[Piano Man] Those damned… things… came back. At first I was glad that I was in the ol’ bar when they came ‘round, now I reckon I'm gonna die in here. Well, if I'm gonna go I'd rather go out here, surrounded by memories of the good ol’ times. My only regret is that I couldn't see her one last time… sweet ol’ Cailie. I sure hope she got away. In case you ever see this Cailie, if you ever come back to this dusty ol’ town, just know, I love ya, always have, and I always will. -Felipe
