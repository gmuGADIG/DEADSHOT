‘Callie.’
‘Those damned things came back and forced us all into a corner. I’ve made peace with myself that this place may very well be my tomb.’
‘I don’t feel empty. I could’ve left long ago when the soul of Slimwater dried up, but I stayed for this Saloon. I’m choosing to die in a place full of cherished memories. Past love, past happiness.’ 
‘If you are reading this, I hope you’ve managed to get away safely, and that a grim fate no longer lies in your way.’
‘I never held a note for you when I played, Callie. It’d ruin the rhythm of your beautiful dancing. So don’t hold your breath for me, Callie. Don’t linger here. You’ve made this life worth living to me, Callie. I love you.’
‘Sincerely, Felipe’"
