‘The three watching from on high stripped the child of all its joys and all it’s worth. They abandoned it, leaving it trapped and alone, the life and prosperity it provided rotted and withered.’ 
‘The child was left without the love it craved, and so did the seekers and worshipers alongside it. It made them into a horror that made the child yearn for the love and nurture it once had.’"
