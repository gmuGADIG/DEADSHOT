[Slug] “We had our fun when those lil’ critters came back. Used double the gunpowder for some real fat splatterin’, but...”
“Ugh, we.... We just wanted to cause a ruckus like we always do! But there was this, this thin little pup who was sneakin’ around all scared-like. We noticed it after we had set the charges.”

“Gah, that idiot! Why did we think double-packing our dynamite was a good idea?!”
