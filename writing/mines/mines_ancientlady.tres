I see it in you, too—you wear a type of garment unfamiliar to my time of origin, but through it I see parts of that ancient child. The desperate twinkle in one’s eye, as it seeks approval. A namesake.\"
[ ] The helpless lady’s words ring insignificant to you.
[Ancient Lady] \"How rudely it speaks of me.
My life should only be as eternal as its affection for me. I thought by mothering the child, it would permit me to share in its power.\" 
\"But now you see me here, withering. 
A child so desperate for its birthright, when a better path lay before it all along...\"
[ ] You begin to realize she speaks nonsense
[Ancient Lady] \"Nay. I’ve learned this tongue quickly from the brief time you and your townsfolk have been tied to the child. I hear your thoughts, 'gunslinger.' Lately I struggle to discern which are truly your own.\"
