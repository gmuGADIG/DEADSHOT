“I see it in you, too. That desperate twinkle in one’s eye as they vie for approval. The shapeless child would bear it, too, if it only had a face of its own...a face for its mothers to love.”
[ ] The lady’s words ring insignificant to you.
[Feathered Lady] “Nay, I know the meaning these words carry—I’ve learned them well in the brief time you and your townsfolk have been tied to the child.”
[ ] The lady speaks nonsensically.
[Feathered Lady] “Those words are a mere taste of its cruelty. 
The child was always envious that I would walk the land of its ancestors and pray to them.”
“Now it traps me in a bramble of its own creation, with roots that drain its blessing of vitality from me. An insatiable hunger for undivided worship...”
[ ] You cannot make sense of this lady. Best to move along.
[Feathered Lady] “Yes, move along. I hear your thoughts, ‘gunslinger.’” “Lately I struggle to discern which are truly your own. Some, though...some give me hope. Ah, yes...some bring me peace.”
[ ] ...
[ ] Which thoughts are those, gunslinger?"
